Art of Teaching Mathematical Calculus for Engineers, Scientists, Analysts and Researchers

The art of teaching mathematics is often encountered with challenges in preparing up to date and appropriate materials with certain real cases for students as the pupils who later in the next semester will be given the opts to choose from various job interests, such as engineers, scientists, analysts, and the others, all of whom also demand to be a researcher indirectly. The problem faced is that if the teaching is too focused purely on mathematics, but the students are apparently from the informatics engineering department, the materials will be inappropriate with their application in real cases, and vice versa. In this study, several complete materials that we call “Academia Smart Art for Teaching Mathematics (ASAFTM)” or “meta-STREAM” based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm as prototype meta-Deep AI Engine for improve learning process and outcome of any education level were presented as a solution to answer these problems, i.e., by providing teaching materials starting from the Development of Pure Mathematical Concepts, for example related to one of the materials, i.e., Integral-based Generative Modeling for approaches to the calculation of Areas and Volumes of Semi-Continuous Areas, the development of mathematics for Business Start-up Ideas, and Real Case Simulation, especially the ones related to current cases, for example regarding the prediction of the number of recovered Covid-19 patients using matrix-derived techniques, all of which are covered with implementations in the form of the Python programming language until they are given certain open problems as challenges. These open problems can later be included as the closing material. From the results of the application of several materials with teaching strategies using the art of teaching mathematics, from the student evaluation, they were able to explore their creative ideas as a solver for real cases in society and cases that became national and international issues with science significantly relevant with the course materials in semester 5 or above when they have started to choose courses based on their interest that are also in line with the independent learning curriculum and even after they graduate from college. Therefore, the materials truly educate students’ competence to create solutions for the world even though they use mathematical calculus that to date merely becomes a very basic material.
